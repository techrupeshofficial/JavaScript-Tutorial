const accountId =223232
let accountName ="Rupesh"
var accountEmail ="test@gmail.com"
// accountCity = "Mumbai"           this is not good way to variable declaration 

// accountId =232324           we can not chnage constant variable 
accountName ="Alex"
accountEmail ="alex@gmail.com"

// var we can redeclare, but not let and const ,   always use let and var 
// var will created issu in block scope and functional scope , that's why always use let and var
